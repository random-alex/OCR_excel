# OCR_excel
Course project

There are a problem in my university - teachers are have to fill in the examination sheet by hand, and then migrate data to ecxel spreadsheet again by hand. One can think, that it's a not a big problem, but whet it's your 3 exam, and after all work you have to fill in 3 documents with bill of marks for about of 55-70 students - it makes situation a lit big harder. So my idea - teacher make a photo of a bill, and my program make OCR and give him a excel file.
